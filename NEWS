CHANGES IN DMRcate VERSION 1.0.2

BUG FIXES
•	annotate() renamed to cpg.annotate to avoid clashes with same-named function in ggplot2

NEW FEATURES
•	Kernel estimator has been rewritten from scratch without the need for ks:::kde. Now only takes moderated t-values as cpg weights, as required by the chi-square transformation. 
•	Now allows for multi-level factor experiments, as allowed by limma. Contrasts should be specified with a contrast matrix, otherwise the design matrix MUST have an intercept. (Thanks to Tim Triche Jr. and David Martino for their advice).
•	A GRanges object can be produced from the results.
•	XY probes can also be filtered out using rmSNPandCH().
•	DMR.plot() allows group median lines to be plotted to better visualise distances between groups (Thanks to Susan van Dijk and Magnus Tobiasson for their advice).

CHANGES IN DMRcate VERSION 1.4.1 

- Extra control for Type I error through DMR constituents made commensurate with # of differential limma probes
- CITATIONs added

CHANGES IN DMRcate VERSION 1.7.2

- Major changes. WGBS pipeline is now implemented with DSS as a regression step instead of limma.  Currently restricted to 2-group comparisons for WGBS, but multifactor and continuous response will be available in future versions. 450K pipeline is the same, but with slight cosmetic changes in anticipation of the transition to the EPIC array.
- DMR.plot() has been completely rewritten, now with Gviz and inbuilt transcript annotation for hg19, hg38 and mm10.
- DMRs are now ranked by the Stouffer transformations of the limma- and DSS- derived FDRs of their constituent CpG sites.
