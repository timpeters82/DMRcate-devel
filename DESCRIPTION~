Description: De novo identification and extraction of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in the human genome using Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array data. Provides functionality for filtering probes possibly confounded by SNPs and cross-hybridisation. Includes bedGraph generation, GRanges generation and plotting functions.
